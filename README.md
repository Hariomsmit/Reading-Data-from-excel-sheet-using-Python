# Reading-Data-from-excel-sheet-using-Python
In this small project, I have used the xlrd module 1.2.0 version which is commonly used in python to handle Excel sheets. It has many child classes like obj=xlrd.open_workbook(loc) ; page=obj.sheet_by_index(0) ; page.cell_value(0,0) etc which allows to access excel sheet data using python programming.
